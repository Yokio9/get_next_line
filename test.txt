Harry Potter has been orphaned and lives at home with his abominable aunt and uncle and the unbearable cousin Dudley.
Harry feels very sad and lonely, until one day he receives a letter that will change his life forever.
In it he is informed that he has been accepted as a student at Hogwarts School of Magic.
From that moment on, Harry's luck takes a spectacular turn. In this special school he will learn enchantments, fabulous tricks and defense tactics against evil arts.
He will become the school champion of Quidditch, a kind of aerial soccer played on broomsticks, and he will make a handful of good friends... but also some fearsome enemies.
But, above all, he will learn the secrets that will allow him to fulfill his destiny. For, although it may not seem so at first glance, Harry is no ordinary boy: he is a real wizard!
